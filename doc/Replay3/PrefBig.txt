Recommended Settings of ARMovie$PrefBigMode

It is worth experimenting with ARMovie$Interpolate also; interpolation will use up more
CPU time to paint an image. The default value of ARMovie$PrefBigMode is "13;49;28" which
is not ideal unless you have a type 1 monitor, or you only play 'small' movies.

RISC OS 2, 3; VIDC1 Machines:

--type 0 monitor--

All machines:    13

Note: adding another mode which was basically mode 13 with eigx=eigy=0 would allow larger
movies to be played.

--type 1 monitor--

All machines:    13;28

--type 3 or 4 monitor--

//obtain mode extension module from Customer Services which provides 320x480x8bpp screen mode
//selected as mode 49. Otherwise type 1 state for ARMovie$PrefBigMode will work with the
//monitor selecting a 'letterbox' mode, or use 28 only.

All machines:    49;28

--with CC ColourCard or StateMachine ColourBurst/G8/G16

//contact CC or StateMachine. Default state will work. Cards are capable of 320x256x16bpp on
//type 0/1 monitor and of 320x480x16bpp on type 3/4: appropriate screen mode numbers can be
//put into ARMovie$PrefBigMode.

RISC OS 3.5; VIDC20 Machines

--type 0 monitor--

no VRAM          x384y288c32kex2ey2;x384y288c32kex0ey0
VRAM             x384y288c16mex2ey2;x384y288c16mex0ey0

(other big modes are possible such as x320y256c16mex2ey2)

--type 1 monitor--

no VRAM          x240y352c32kex1ey0;x320y256c32kex0ey0;x384y288c32kex0ey0
VRAM             x384y288c16mex2ey2;x480y352c16mex2ey2;x480y352c16mex0ey0

--type 3 or 4 monitor--

no VRAM          x240y352c32kex1ey0;x320y480c32kex2ey1;x480y352c32kex0ey0
VRAM             x320y480c16mex2ey1;x480y352c16mex2ey2;x480y352c16mex0ey0

(note that the 240x352 mode does not allow interpolation, but is very useful
in small memory machines although a movie won't quite fill the screen. The trailing
modes with ex0ey0 allow for very large movies)
