I'm sorry - you've been sitting in a spam filter. On the bright side,
at least I do look in spam filters some times!

What's the problem there? Its well documented (read the ColourIf
document) and there's source of all the programmes. See also FastConv.

6Y5UV is the colour space information, 6 bits of Y and 5 bits of U and
